# Hello World!
* This repository is for TheOdinProject's Google Homepage project.
* I shall gauge my competency by listing down the thought processes, realizations, skill I picked up, and more while building the homepage.

## Realizations
* Oh, this README.md is created using **GNU Nano**. I never though that creating a Markdown file from the terminal would be this cool!
