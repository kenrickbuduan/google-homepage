# Hello World!
* This repository is for TheOdinProject's Google Homepage project.
* I shall gauge my competency by listing down the thought processes, realizations, skill I picked up, and more while building the homepage.

## Thought Processes
* I have used CSS Flex since Google's original homepage also uses this.

## Skills I Learned
* [X] CSS Flex
    * [X] Setting flex items to have a space between each
    * [X] Setting flex items to wrap automatically
* [X] Using Material Icons

## Realizations
* Oh, this README.md is created using **GNU Nano**. I never though that creating a Markdown file from the terminal would be this cool!
* Using CSS Flex is an elegant solution for aligning items. It's much simpler to grasp than CSS Grid.
    * However, I am also confused as to what should I use: CSS Flex or CSS Grid?
* To specify Material Icons in your webpage, you need to insert it just as how you would insert a font from Google Font.
